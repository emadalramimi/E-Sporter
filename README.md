## Overview

E-Sporter is a comprehensive application designed to manage esports tournaments, from local to prestigious international competitions. Developed by Team 9, this project caters to the operational needs of managing, tracking, and analyzing esports competitions for the game League of Legends, focusing on a standalone application for the E-sporter organization.

## Objectives

- To provide a robust solution for managing esports tournaments, including team registrations, match scheduling, and result tracking.
- To enable administrators and referees to efficiently oversee tournament progress, calculate points, and determine winners based on a set of predefined rules.
- To facilitate a detailed view of tournament standings, team points history, and season palmarès (awards).

## Features

- **Team Management**: Create, modify, and delete teams participating in tournaments.
- **Tournament Management**: Support for creating and removing tournaments, along with managing match outcomes and tournament progression.
- **Match and Points Management**: Enter match scores, calculate team points, and generate detailed match reports.
